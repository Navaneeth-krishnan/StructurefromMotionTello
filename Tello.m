%% Structure From Motion From Multiple Views
% Structure from motion (SfM) is the process of estimating the 3-D structure 
% of a scene from a set of 2-D views. It is used in many applications, such 
% as robot navigation, autonomous driving, and augmented reality. This 
% example shows you how to estimate the poses of a calibrated camera from 
% a sequence of views, and reconstruct the 3-D structure of the scene up to
% an unknown scale factor.

%% Overview
% This example shows how to reconstruct a 3-D scene from a sequence of 2-D
% views taken with a camera calibrated using the
% <matlab:helpview(fullfile(docroot,'toolbox','vision','vision.map'),'visionCameraCalibrator'); Camera Calibrator app>.
% The example uses a |viewSet| object to store and manage the data
% associated with each view, such as the camera pose and the image points,
% as well as matches between points from pairs of views. 
%
% The example uses the pairwise point matches to estimate the camera pose of
% the current view relative to the previous view. It then links the
% pairwise matches into longer point tracks spanning multiple views using
% the |findTracks| method of the |viewSet| object. These tracks then serve
% as inputs to multiview triangulation using the |triangulateMultiview|
% function and the refinement of camera poses and the 3-D scene points
% using the |bundleAdjustment| function.
%
% The example consists of two main parts: camera motion estimation and
% dense scene reconstruction. In the first part, the example estimates the
% camera pose for each view using a sparse set of points matched across the
% views. In the second part, the example iterates over the sequence of
% views again, using |vision.PointTracker| to track a dense set of points
% across the views, to compute a dense 3-D reconstruction of the scene.
%
% The camera motion estimation algorithm consists of the following steps:
%
% # For each pair of consecutive images, find a set of point
% correspondences. This example detects the interest points using the
% |detectSURFFeatures| function, extracts the feature descriptors using the
% |extractFeatures| functions, and finds the matches using the
% |matchFeatures| function. Alternatively, you can track the points across
% the views using |vision.PointTracker|.
% # Estimate the relative pose of the current view, which is the camera
% orientation and location relative to the previous view. The example uses
% a helper function |helperEstimateRelativePose|, which calls
% |estimateEssentialMatrix| and |relativeCameraPose|.
% # Transform the relative pose of the current view into the coordinate
% system of the first view of the sequence.
% # Store the current view attributes: the camera pose and the image
% points.
% # Store the inlier matches between the previous and the current view.
% # Find point tracks across all the views processed so far.
% # Use the |triangulateMultiview| function to compute the initial 3-D
% locations corresponding to the tracks.
% # Use the |bundleAdjustment| function to refine the camera poses and the
% 3-D points.
% Store the refined camera poses in the |viewSet| object.

%% Read the Input Image Sequence
% Read and display the image sequence.

% Use |imageDatastore| to get a list of all image file names in a
% directory.
imageDir = fullfile('images/');
imds = imageDatastore(imageDir);

% Convert the images to grayscale.
images = cell(1, numel(imds.Files));
for i = 1:numel(imds.Files)
    I = readimage(imds, i);
    images{i} = rgb2gray(I);
end

%% Load Camera Parameters
% Load the |cameraParameters| object created using the 
% <matlab:helpview(fullfile(docroot,'toolbox','vision','vision.map'),'visionCameraCalibrator'); Camera Calibrator app>.

%load(fullfile(imageDir, 'cameraParams.mat'));

%% Create a View Set Containing the First View
% Use a |viewSet| object to store and manage the image points and the
% camera pose associated with each view, as well as point matches between
% pairs of views. Once you populate a |viewSet| object, you can use it to
% find point tracks across multiple views and retrieve the camera poses to
% be used by |triangulateMultiview| and |bundleAdjustment| functions.

% Undistort the first image.
I = undistortImage(images{1}, cameraParams1); 


% Detect features. Increasing 'NumOctaves' helps detect large-scale
% features in high-resolution images. Use an ROI to eliminate spurious
% features around the edges of the image.
border = 50;
roi = [border, border, size(I, 2)- 2*border, size(I, 1)- 2*border];
prevPoints   = detectSURFFeatures(I, 'NumOctaves', 8, 'ROI', roi);
% Extract features. Using 'Upright' features improves matching, as long as
% the camera motion involves little or no in-plane rotation.
prevFeatures = extractFeatures(I, prevPoints, 'Upright', true);

% Create an empty viewSet object to manage the data associated with each
% view.
vSet = viewSet;

% Add the first view. Place the camera associated with the first view
% and the origin, oriented along the Z-axis.
viewId = 1;
vSet = addView(vSet, viewId, 'Points', prevPoints, 'Orientation', ...
    eye(3, 'like', prevPoints.Location), 'Location', ...
    zeros(1, 3, 'like', prevPoints.Location));

%% Add the Rest of the Views
% Go through the rest of the images. For each image
%
% # Match points between the previous and the current image.
% # Estimate the camera pose of the current view relative to the previous
%   view.
% # Compute the camera pose of the current view in the global coordinate 
%   system relative to the first view.
% # Triangulate the initial 3-D world points.
% # Use bundle adjustment to refine all camera poses and the 3-D world
%   points.
